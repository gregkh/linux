		SCHED_EXT EXAMPLE SCHEDULERS
		============================

Introduction
============

This directory contains a number of example sched_ext schedulers. These
schedulers are meant to provide examples of different types of schedulers
that can be built using sched_ext, and illustrate how various features of
sched_ext can be used.

Some of the examples are performant, production-ready schedulers. That is, for
the correct workload and with the correct tuning, they may be deployed in a
production environment with acceptable or possibly even improved performance.
Others are just examples that in practice, would not provide acceptable
performance (though they could be improved to get there).

This README will describe these example schedulers, including describing the
types of workloads or scenarios they're designed to accommodate, and whether or
not they're production ready. For more details on any of these schedulers,
please see the header comment in their .bpf.c file.


Compiling the examples
======================

There are a few toolchain dependencies for compiling the example schedulers.

Toolchain dependencies
----------------------

1. clang >= 17.0

The schedulers are BPF programs, and therefore must be compiled with clang. gcc
is actively working on adding a BPF backend compiler as well, but are still
missing some features such as BTF type tags which are necessary for using
kptrs.

clang 17.0 has not yet been released, so you'll need to compile it yourself if
you want to compile the benchmarks.

2. rustup nightly

Atropos's user space load balancing component is written in Rust, and uses
nightly features. You'll need to use the nightly build from rustup in order to
compile it.

There are other requirements as well, such as make, but these are the main /
non-trivial ones.

Compiling the schedulers
------------------------

Once you have your toolchain setup, you can compile the schedulers as follows:

$ make CC=clang LLVM=1 -j

See Documentation/scheduler/sched-ext.rst for a description of the config
options required to compile a sched_ext kernel.

Schedulers
==========

This section lists, in alphabetical order, all of the current example
schedulers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Atropos
-------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A multi-domain, BPF / user space hybrid scheduler. The BPF portion of the
scheduler does a simple round robin in each domain, and the user space portion
(written in Rust) calculates the load factor of each domain, and informs BPF of
how tasks should be load balanced accordingly.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atropos is designed to be flexible, and accommodate different architectures and
workloads. Various load balancing thresholds (e.g. greediness, frequenty, etc),
as well as how Atropos should partition the system into scheduling domains, can
be tuned to achieve the optimal configuration for any given system or workload.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. If tuned correctly, Atropos should be performant across various CPU
architectures and workloads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_central
-----------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A "central" scheduler where scheduling decisions are made from a single CPU.
This scheduler illustrates how scheduling decisions can be dispatched from a
single CPU, allowing other cores to run with infinite slices, without timer
ticks, and without having to incur the overhead of making scheduling decisions.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This scheduler could theoretically be useful for any workload that benefits
from minimizing scheduling overhead and timer ticks. An example of where this
could be particularly useful is running VMs, where running with infinite slices
and no timer ticks allows the VM to avoid unnecessary expensive vmexits.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not yet. While tasks are run with an infinite slice (SCX_SLICE_INF), they're
preempted every 20ms in a timer callback. The scheduler also puts the core
schedling logic inside of the central / scheduling CPU's ops.dispatch() path,
and does not yet have any kind of priority mechanism.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_flatcg
----------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A flattened cgroup hierarchy scheduler. This scheduler implements hierarchical
weight-based cgroup CPU control by flattening the cgroup hierarchy into a
single layer, by compounding the active weight share at each level. The effect
of this is a much more performant CPU controller, which does not need to
descend down cgroup trees in order to properly compute a cgroup's share.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This scheduler could be useful for any typical workload requiring a CPU
controller, but which cannot tolerate the higher overheads of the fair CPU
controller.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, though the scheduler (currently) does not adequately accommodate
thundering herds of cgroups. If, for example, many cgroups which are nested
behind a low-priority cgroup were to wake up around the same time, they may be
able to consume more CPU cycles than they are entitled to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_pair
--------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A sibling scheduler which ensures that tasks will only ever be co-located on a
physical core if they're in the same cgroup. It illustrates how a scheduling
policy could be implemented to mitigate CPU bugs, such as L1TF, and also shows
how some useful kfuncs such as scx_bpf_kick_cpu() can be utilized.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While this scheduler is only meant to be used to illustrate certain sched_ext
features, with a bit more work (e.g. by adding some form of priority handling
inside and across cgroups), it could have been used as a way to quickly
mitigate L1TF before core scheduling was implemented and rolled out.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_qmap
--------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Another simple, yet slightly more complex scheduler that provides an example of
a basic weighted FIFO queuing policy. It also provides examples of some common
useful BPF features, such as sleepable per-task storage allocation in the
ops.prep_enable() callback, and using the BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE map type to
enqueue tasks. It also illustrates how core-sched support could be implemented.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purely used to illustrate sched_ext features.

**Production Ready?**

No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_simple
----------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A simple scheduler that provides an example of a minimal sched_ext
scheduler. scx_simple can be run in either global weighted vtime mode, or
FIFO mode.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though very simple, this scheduler should perform reasonably well on
single-socket CPUs with a uniform L3 cache topology. Note that while running in
global FIFO mode may work well for some workloads, saturating threads can
easily drown out inactive ones.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This scheduler could be used in a production environment, assuming the hardware
constraints enumerated above, and assuming the workload can accommodate a
simple scheduling policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scx_userland
------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A simple weighted vtime scheduler where all scheduling decisions take place in
user space. This is in contrast to Atropos, where load balancing lives in user
space, but scheduling decisions are still made in the kernel.

Typical Use Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many advantages to writing schedulers in user space. For example, you
can use a debugger, you can write the scheduler in Rust, and you can use data
structures bundled with your favorite library.

On the other hand, user space scheduling can be hard to get right. You can
potentially deadlock due to not scheduling a task that's required for the
scheduler itself to make forward progress (though the sched_ext watchdog will
protect the system by unloading your scheduler after a timeout if that
happens). You also have to bootstrap some communication protocol between the
kernel and user space.

A more robust solution to this would be building a user space scheduling
framework that abstracts much of this complexity away from you.

Production Ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. This scheduler uses an ordered list for vtime scheduling, and is stricly
less performant than just using something like `scx_simple`. It is purely
meant to illustrate that it's possible to build a user space scheduler on
top of sched_ext.
