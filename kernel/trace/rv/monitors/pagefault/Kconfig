	  Monitor that real-time tasks do not raise page faults, causing
	  undesirable latency.

	  If you are developing a real-time system and not entirely sure whether
	  the applications are designed correctly for real-time, you want to say
	  Y here.

	  This monitor does not affect execution speed while it is not running,
	  therefore it is safe to enable this in production kernel.
